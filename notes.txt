Variables in a Makefile are like shortcuts or labels for values you don’t want to repeat.
They're written like this:

NAME = push_swap
SRCS = main.c utils.c
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________
Then later, you can use them like this:

$(NAME)
$(SRCS)
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________
“To build this (target), I need these (dependencies), and here’s how to do it (commands).”

target: dependencies
	commands to build the target

%.o=%.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $@ -o @<

$@ = target
$< = dependencies

-c means "compile only, don’t link"
It turns a .c file into a .o file (object file)
Use it when you want to compile files separately

-o means "output file name"
It lets you choose the name of the file gcc makes (like main.o or program)

Usually in Makefiles:
  compile with -c and -o to get .o files
  then link all .o files to make the final program

char **str means you already have an array of strings somewhere and just want to use it — you’re passing a pointer to that existing array.
int **num_out means you want the function to create or change the pointer itself (make it point somewhere new), so you pass a pointer to the pointer.
